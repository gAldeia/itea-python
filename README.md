Package for Interaction-Transformation Evolutionary Algorithm implementation (ITEA) in python for Classification and Regression. The algorithm is based on scikit-learn guidelines for creating ML classes and can be integrated with their tools.

The Interaction-Transformation representation is a step towards obtaining simpler and more interpretable results, searching in the mathematical equations space by means of an evolutionary strategy.

Together with ITEA for Classification and Regression, we provide a model-specific explainer based on the Partial Effects to help users get a better understanding of the resulting expressions.
