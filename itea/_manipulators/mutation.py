"""Mutation methods.

The mutations are the core evolutionary aspect of ITEA, since the algorithm
does not have an crossover operator. This file implements several mutations
that defines different ways of exploring the neighborhood of the expressions.

All mutation methods should work with an expr (list os IT terms, 
not an instance of ``ITExpr``), and does not change the expr list passed as 
argument. Instead, it should create a new list to avoid collateral effects.

For more informations, please see the original itea paper:
"FranÃ§a, F., & Aldeia, G. (2020).
Interaction-Transformation Evolutionary Algorithm for Symbolic Regression.
Evolutionary Computation, 1-25."
